There are two commands to schedule tasks in Linux: cron and at.
The cron command is used to repeatedly schedule a task at a specific time. The tasks are stored in a cron file and then executed using the cron command. The cron command reads the string from this file and schedules the task. The syntax for the string to enter in the cron file is as follows:
<minute> <hour> <day> <month> <weekday> <command>
Suppose you want to run a command at 4 pm every Sunday, then the string would be:
0 16 * * 0 <command>
The at command is used to schedule a task only once at the specified time.

$ echo "shutdown now" | at -m 18:00.
